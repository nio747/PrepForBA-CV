# CS231n-Assign1: kNN, SVM, SoftMax, two-layer-neural-network

The goals of this assignment:

- understand: **Image Classification pipeline**, the data-driven approach(train/predict stages)
- triain/val/test **splits**, using validation data for **hyperparameter tuning**.
- **vectorized** code with numpy
- implement: **kNN** k-Nearest Neighbor
- **SVM**: Multiclass Support Vector Machine Classifier
- **Softmax**
- **Two layer neural network** Classifier
- differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers
- performance improvements from using **higher-level representations** than raw pixels. *color histograms, HOG features..*
